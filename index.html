                 I'm a student studying to be web developer from Seattle, Washington. I recently started to learn how to code at UW!
                 I love learning the logic and the structure behind coding and turning the code into efficient and beautiful code. 
                 Also, I'm excited to learn to learn the design aspect of coding. I want to be able to take intricate problems and turn those 
                 problems into simple and beautiful design that is accessible for all users. When I'm not studying or coding, you'll find me trying out new makeup looks, hanging out out with my dog, 
                 and binge watching Game of Thrones.
